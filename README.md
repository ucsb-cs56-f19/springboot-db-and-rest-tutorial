# mapache-search-engine

The Mapache Search Engine is a project of students enrolled in the course [CMPSC 56](https://ucsb-cs56.github.io) at UC Santa Barbara.

The idea is to provide a front end to a web search engine (likely Google) that:
* tailors its results towards ones helpful to students working on software development projects for CMPSC 56, which is a Java-based application development course.  
* allows users to upvote and downvote search results based on usefulness to particular queries
* allows users to enter notes about search results (e.g. "this link helped me to solve such and such a problem")
* gives preference to results that have been upvoted by other students in the course.

The search engine is intended to be used as part of an NSF sponsored project that seeks to understand how to help students develop better skills to be prepared for real world software development careers.   More information on the NSF grant is here: <https://brownfield-team.github.io>

NOTE: Include *.yml in your .gitignore so you don't publicly share your Github developer secret keys
